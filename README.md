# Nesu-Bird-3D-Game
"Nesu Bird" is a game inspired by the 3D version of "Angry Birds." The game is presented in multiple levels. To win a level, players must knock down the "enemy" characters by launching birds towards them. As the levels progress, the "enemy" characters become increasingly challenging to defeat.

The game is developed using the Unity application, and the asset design is done using Blender.

This is a final project of Computer Human Interaction Class, Teknik Informatika, Universitas Padjadjaran.
